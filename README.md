# tenant-receipt

Code used to

- Notify the rent not sent
- generate automatic tenant receipt and send it by email.

## Detail

The code is written in appscript and use google drive and gmail.

## TODO

- Have to tool to do number to text in french
- Connect the app to airtable instead of config file
- Alert tenant when payment has not been received (a letter should be sent to the tenant maximum 15 days after the payment has been required. So we decided to send an email recall 7 days after the date.)
- Move to the bin when the process is done
