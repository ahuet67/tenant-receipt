# tenant-receipt

Code used to

- Notify the rent not sent
- generate automatic tenant receipt and send it by email.

## Detail

The code is written in appscript and use google drive and gmail.

## TODO

- Alert tenant when payment has not been received (a letter should be sent to the tenant maximum 15 days after the payment has been required. So we decided to send an email recall 7 days after the date.)
- Move to the bin when the process is done
- Set up 2 alerts moments depending of the date of payment requested (some are the 1st, some are the 10th)
