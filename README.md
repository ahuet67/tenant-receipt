# tenant-receipt

Code used to generate automatic tenant receipt and send it by email.
It has been extended to send also alert owners that the payment has not been received

The code is written in appscript and use google drive and gmail.

## TODO

- Alert tenant when payment has not been received (a letter should be sent to the tenant maximum 15 days after the payment has been required. So we decided to send an email recall 7 days after the date.)
- Move to the bin when the process is done
