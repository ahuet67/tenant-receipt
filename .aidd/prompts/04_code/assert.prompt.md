# Goal

Assert that this feature works as intended.

## Rules

- Do not stop until the feature works as intended.

## Steps

Iterate over those steps until the feature work as intended.

1. List assertions to validate the feature.
2. For each assertion, fix any issues preventing it from passing.
   1. After fixing, re-run this assertion to confirm it passes.
3. Once all assertions pass, re-run all the checks again to ensure every assertion is passing.
